                Stephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and
                 best-selling author who worked on the physics of black holes. He 
                 proposed that black holes would emit subatomic particles until they 
                 eventually exploded and drew upon both relativity theory and quantum 
                 mechanics
